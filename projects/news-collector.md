# Project Description
This is full stack news application with account feature that allows users to search for news articles using a search bar and save their favorite articles to own account.

# Project Overview

## Introduction
This project embarked with the aim of diving into full-stack application development using Spring and React. It was a solitary endeavor where I managed all aspects of the project from inception to deployment. 

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: AWS

The core objective was to grasp and implement a full-stack application, with a focus on harnessing the power of React for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence. The journey extended to deploying the application on AWS, achieving a comprehensive understanding and hands-on experience across the spectrum of modern web development.

## Challenges
One of the major hurdles encountered during this project was navigating through the complex configuration of Spring Security. Particularly, authorizing users post-login posed to be a challenging task. The intricacies of security settings required a steep learning curve which demanded a deeper understanding of both Spring Security framework and authentication mechanisms. This was a critical part of ensuring a secure user experience and a pivotal learning experience in the project.

# Future Plans

- **Transition to Different Technologies**:
  - Rebuild the project using either Next.js or Svelte to explore and leverage the capabilities of different frontend frameworks.
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Aim to deploy the revamped project on Vercel, transitioning from the current deployment on Fly.io.

- **Extended Functionality**:
  - Enhance the application to not only fetch news but also search and save general web pages, broadening the scope and utility of the project for users.

Initially, the deployment was carried out on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, but due to extensive usage of free-tier resources, I transitioned to deploying on Fly.io. Moving forward, I am planning to rebuild the project using either Next.js or Svelte and aim to deploy it on Vercel. Additionally, I intend to extend the functionality of the application not only to fetch news but also to search and save general web pages. This will expand the utility of the project and provide a broader service to the users, making it a more comprehensive web application.
